# All public DeveloppeurPascal projects in one project

Install all of my public repositories as sub folders of current project.

This project simplify downloading all repositories from [DeveloppeurPascal GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal) and their dependencies.

If you download ZIP file from GitHub it will be empty. You must use "git" command or a GUI to clone or fork and then import this project and its submodules.

Just clone this repository with sub modules and you'll have all my public work available on GitHub.


After cloning this repository, don't forget to update all projects with the command :

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

If you didn't clone the project with its sub modules, use those git commands : 

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
```
