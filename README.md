# All public DeveloppeurPascal projects in one code repository

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Install all of my public repositories as sub folders of current project.

This code repository simplify downloading all repositories from [DeveloppeurPascal GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal) and their dependencies.

## Talks and conferences

### Twitch

Follow my development streams of software, video games, mobile applications and websites on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin) or as replays on [Serial Streameur](https://serialstreameur.fr) mostly in French.

## Source code installation

If you download a ZIP file from GitHub it will be empty. You must use "git" command or a GUI to clone or fork this code repository with its submodules.

After cloning this repository, don't forget to update all projects with the command :

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

If you didn't clone the project with its sub modules, use those git commands : 

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
```

[This repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects) and all projects are available on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal).

## License

This project is under the MIT license. It's not the case for all of my other projects. Take a look at every LICENSE and README.md file before doing garbage.

## Project packages

To simplify GitHub account backups or local installation of projects, I offer several thematic repository packs. You can use them to download the relevant projects and check them out. They're probably not compilable as is, but they'll give you an idea of the open source projects available on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal), and you'll still be able to access them directly.
