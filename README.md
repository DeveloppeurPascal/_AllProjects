# All public DeveloppeurPascal projects in one code repository

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

Install all of my public repositories as sub folders of current project.

This code repository simplify downloading all repositories from [DeveloppeurPascal GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal) and their dependencies.

It contains projects developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

## Install

If you download a ZIP file from GitHub it will be empty. You must use "git" command or a GUI to clone or fork this code repository with its submodules.

After cloning this repository, don't forget to update all projects with the command :

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

If you didn't clone the project with its sub modules, use those git commands : 

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
```

[This repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects) and all projects are available on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal).

## Project packages

To simplify GitHub account backups or local installation of projects, I offer several thematic repository packs. You can use them to download the relevant projects and check them out. They're probably not compilable as is, but they'll give you an idea of the open source projects available on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal), and you'll still be able to access them directly.

* [video games](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Games-Pack)
* [utilities and mobile applications](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-WorkingPrograms-Pack)
* [libraries and components](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/DevPas-Components-Pack)
* [all the public projects in my account](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/_AllProjects)

To prepare my Delphi developer work environment on a new Windows computer or VM, I've also included [an installation script](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/__MyMinimalDependenciesForWorkingWithDelphi). You can use it as is, or take inspiration from it if you're using my libraries or components.

If you're looking for examples and demos of how to use certain Delphi features, take a look at [this code repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples) and [its list of other example repositories](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-samples/blob/main/OtherDelphiSampleRepositories.md).
